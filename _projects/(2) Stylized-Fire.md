# Stylized Fire

The Movies Project is something like [**Netflix**](https://www.netflix.com/browse), the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.

{% capture carousel_images %}

{% endcapture %}
{% include elements/carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="5" %}
