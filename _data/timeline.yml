  description: I received deliveries for the store, assisting the unloading of lorries as well as loaded the stores’ salvage. 
               I organised cages of stock to be section compliant so that merchandising was simple for the rest of the team. I 
               replenished stock, faced the shelves, and ensured appropriate stock rotation was in place. I’d completed the in-house 
               food hygiene course which enabled me to manage the food stocks within the store. I organised the warehouse after 
               deliveries and often built fixtures/shelves for new products. I updated scan labels and provided customer service to shoppers.

  from: Oct 2019
  to: Oct 2019
  description: I volunteered via my Cambridge Regional College course to test the, at the time upcoming game, Planet Zoo. Throughout 
               my time spent at the studio I learnt the QA systems that Frontier studios used to test games and applied that knowledge
               in order to report issues with the game. Notibly I discovered and highlighted a major issue with an x-ray style shader 
               that was rendering models incorrectly through opaque surfaces.

  to: Feb 2019
  description: During this work experience, I shadowed each game development disciplines team, discussing what's
               involved, common practices and the relevant industry standards. This gave me a deep insight early 
               into my development journey as to the production pipelines of games development, the suites of sofware/tools 
               used within each discipline and the keys skills I need to develop in order to enter the industry as a strong
               candidate for employment.
