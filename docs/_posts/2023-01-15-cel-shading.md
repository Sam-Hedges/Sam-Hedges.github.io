## Introduction

Cel-shading, also known as toon shading, is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to give a flat, 2D-like appearance to 3D models and environments. The basic principle of cel-shading is to simplify the lighting and shading of a scene by breaking it down into a series of flat planes, or "cels," that are then colored in a flat, non-gradient manner. This creates a stark contrast between light and shadow, giving the illusion of a 2D comic book or cartoon. The goal of cel-shading is to mimic the look of hand-drawn animation, where each object in the scene is represented by a single, flat color, rather than smoothly transitioning between shades as in traditional 3D rendering.

The basic principle behind cel-shading is to assign a limited number of shades, or "cels," to different regions of the 3D model. These cels are determined by the angle of the surface normal of each pixel in relation to the light source. For example, a surface that is facing directly towards the light source will be assigned the brightest cel, while a surface that is facing away from the light source will be assigned the darkest cel. In between these extremes, additional cels can be assigned to represent the various gradations of light and shadow on the surface.

One common method for implementing cel-shading is to use a "step function" to determine the cel for each pixel. This function compares the angle of the surface normal to a set of predefined threshold angles, and assigns the corresponding cel based on which threshold the angle falls between. For example, if we have three threshold angles of 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees, a surface normal with an angle of 45 degrees would be assigned the second cel, while a surface normal with an angle of 75 degrees would be assigned the third cel.

Another popular method for implementing cel-shading is to use a "gradient function" to determine the cel for each pixel. This function uses a combination of the angle of the surface normal and the angle between the surface normal and the viewer's direction to create a smooth transition between cels. This approach creates a more natural and realistic look than the step function method, but requires more computational resources.

In addition to the basic cel-shading technique, various other techniques can be used to enhance the look of the scene. For example, line rendering can be used to add outlines to the objects in the scene, which can help to define the edges and give a more "hand-drawn" look. Additionally, texture maps can be used to add detailed patterns and textures to the objects, which can help to break up the flat, 2D appearance of the cels.

## History of Cel-Shading

Cel animation, also known as celluloid animation, is a traditional animation technique that involves creating and manipulating individual drawings on transparent celluloid sheets. This technique was first developed in the early 20th century and was widely used in the animation industry until the advent of computer animation in the late 20th century, and is origin that the cel-shading technique harkens its name from. It involves layering multiple cels of the characters and backgrounds which are then shot on a camera. This creates one frame, and once enough frames are accumulated they are then cycled through, like a super advanced flipbook, to create the final animation.  

In the late 1930s Cel animation was first publicly acknowledged, when Disney used the technique on its animated films. Prior to that, the studio had primarily used a different animation technique known as the multiplane camera, which involved animating on multiple layers of glass. However, this technique was expensive and time-consuming. In the early 1930s, the studio began experimenting with cel animation, a technique in which individual drawings are created on transparent celluloid sheets, or cels. This technique was cheaper and more efficient than the multiplane camera technique, and it allowed for more detailed and realistic animation. Disney's first full-length animated feature film, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937), was created using the cel animation technique. The film was a huge success and established Disney as a leader in the animation industry. Disney continued to develop and refine the cel animation technique over the following years. In 1940, Disney Studios released its second feature film, "Pinocchio," which featured even more advanced animation than "Snow White." The studio also introduced the concept of "limited animation," which involved using fewer drawings per second to save time and money. Disney's cel animation technique was widely adopted by other animation studios, becoming the standard for animated films for many years.

The history of anime, or Japanese animation, can be traced back to the early 20th century. In 1917, animator Shimokawa Oten created the first animated film in Japan, which was a short film called "Imokawa Mukuzo Genkanban no Maki." However, it was not until the 1960s, after the huge strides of disney in pioneering cel animation, that anime began to gain widespread popularity in Japan and eventually around the world. One of the key factors that contributed to the popularization of anime was the development of television animation in Japan. In the 1960s, the first anime television series, "Astro Boy," was created by Osamu Tezuka and aired on Japanese television. The series was a huge success and helped to establish anime as a viable medium for storytelling and entertainment. Another important factor that contributed to the popularization of anime was the introduction of anime to international audiences. In the 1970s, anime began to be exported to other countries, starting with the United States. This was largely due to the efforts of American anime fans who formed anime clubs and began to import and distribute anime in the US. One of the reasons for this was that anime began to explore more mature themes and content compared to traditional Disney animation.

One of the first examples of anime that explored adult themes was "Akira" (1988), directed by Katsuhiro Otomo. The film dealt with themes of social and political commentary, cyberpunk, and violence. It was a commercial and critical success and it helped to establish anime as a medium that could handle more mature and complex topics. Another anime that helped to popularize anime with adult themes was "Neon Genesis Evangelion" (1995). The show explored mature themes such as psychological trauma, religious symbolism, and sexuality. It was a commercial success and was highly regarded by both critics and audiences. Additionally, anime has been able to explore more mature themes due to the lack of censorship laws compared to traditional Disney animation which is targeted to a specific age group and subject to censorship laws. This freedom has allowed anime creators to tackle more sensitive and controversial subjects that would not be allowed in traditional Disney animation. Overall the success of cult hits such as "Akira" and "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," which were widely acclaimed for their visually striking animation and compelling storytelling, helped to keep the medium relevent as entertainment moved into the digital era and establish anime as a global cultural phenomenon.

The origins of cel-shading can be traced back to these early days of animation, a simple style that emphasizes striking character designs, emotive expressions, and a stylized vibrant visuals. As a rendering technique, cel-shading was first introduced in the late 1990s, as a way to create 3D models and environments that mimicked the look of hand-drawn cels of past. Characterized by bold lines, bright colors, and a distinct lack of fine details, mades it well-suited to cel-shaded rendering. Additionally, anime's focus on storytelling and character development, rather than photorealism, made it easier for animation and game studios to adopt cel-shading as a cost-effective and efficient way to create 3D entertainment. One of the first examples of cel-shading in animation was the 1992 film "Bugs Bunny: Rabbit Rampage," which used the technique to create a more cartoon-like appearance for the characters.

In the late 1990s, cel-shading began to be used in video games, with the first examples appearing in games like  "Jet Grind Radio" for the Dreamcast in 2000, "Tales of Phantasia" for the PlayStation in 1998 and "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker" for the GameCube in 2002. These early games used cel-shading to create a more stylized and cartoon-like appearance for the characters and environments, and the technique quickly became popular in the gaming industry. These early examples of cel-shaded games used a limited palette of colors and sharp edges to give the appearance of hand-drawn animation. The technique was used to create a more stylized and cartoon-like look that was distinct from the more realistic graphics that were common in other 3D games at the time.

In the following years, cel shading became more popular in video games, with several more games using the technique, such as "Viewtiful Joe" (2003) for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, "Okami" (2006) for the PlayStation 2 and "Borderlands" (2009) for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. In recent years, with the advancement of technology, cel-shading has become more sophisticated and realistic, but still maintains the stylized and cartoon-like look. Games such as "Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch" (2013) and "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" (2017) maintain that traditional cel-shaded look while utilizing modern lighting techniques, visual effects and high definition texturing.

## Advanced Cel-Shading Techniques

In recent years, game developers have begun to use more advanced cel-shading techniques to create even more realistic and detailed cartoon-like graphics. One of these techniques is "subsurface scattering," which simulates the way light penetrates and scatters through translucent materials like skin and leaves. This creates a more realistic and detailed appearance for characters and environments.

Another advanced cel-shading technique is "ambient occlusion," which simulates the way light is blocked by nearby objects, creating more realistic shadows and lighting. This technique is often used in combination with other cel-shading techniques, such as subsurface scattering, to create even more realistic and detailed cartoon-like graphics.

## Conclusion

Cel-shading is a rendering technique that has been used in computer graphics for decades, and it continues to be a popular choice for game developers today. The technique allows for a more stylized and cartoon-like appearance in 3D models and environments, and recent advancements in technology have allowed for more advanced cel-shading techniques such as subsurface scattering and ambient occlusion to be used. With the continued popularity of cel-shading in the gaming industry, it is likely that we will continue to see new and exciting developments in this field in the future.
