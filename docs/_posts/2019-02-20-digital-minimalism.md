## Introduction

Cel-shading, also known as toon shading, is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to create a cartoon-like or comic book-like appearance in 3D models and environments. The basic principle of cel-shading is to simplify the lighting and shading of a scene by breaking it down into a series of flat planes, or "cels," that are then colored in a flat, non-gradient manner. This creates a stark contrast between light and shadow, giving the illusion of a 2D comic book or cartoon.

## History of Cel-Shading

The earliest use of cel-shading can be traced back to the early days of computer animation, where the technique was used to create a more stylized and cartoon-like look for animated films and TV shows. One of the first examples of cel-shading in animation was the 1992 film "Bugs Bunny: Rabbit Rampage," which used the technique to create a more cartoon-like appearance for the characters.

In the late 1990s, cel-shading began to be used in video games, with the first examples appearing in games like "Jet Grind Radio" and "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker." These early games used cel-shading to create a more stylized and cartoon-like appearance for the characters and environments, and the technique quickly became popular in the gaming industry.

Over the years, cel-shading has been used in a wide range of games, from action-adventure games like "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker" and "Okami," to first-person shooters like "Borderlands" and "Call of Duty: Black Ops." The technique has also been used in a variety of other genres, such as racing games, fighting games, and role-playing games.

## Advanced Cel-Shading Techniques

In recent years, game developers have begun to use more advanced cel-shading techniques to create even more realistic and detailed cartoon-like graphics. One of these techniques is "subsurface scattering," which simulates the way light penetrates and scatters through translucent materials like skin and leaves. This creates a more realistic and detailed appearance for characters and environments.

Another advanced cel-shading technique is "ambient occlusion," which simulates the way light is blocked by nearby objects, creating more realistic shadows and lighting. This technique is often used in combination with other cel-shading techniques, such as subsurface scattering, to create even more realistic and detailed cartoon-like graphics.

## Conclusion

Cel-shading is a rendering technique that has been used in computer graphics for decades, and it continues to be a popular choice for game developers today. The technique allows for a more stylized and cartoon-like appearance in 3D models and environments, and recent advancements in technology have allowed for more advanced cel-shading techniques such as subsurface scattering and ambient occlusion to be used. With the continued popularity of cel-shading in the gaming industry, it is likely that we will continue to see new and exciting developments in this field in the future.
