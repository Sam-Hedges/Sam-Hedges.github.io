# TODO: Remove All these gaudy titles, why did i ever write like this as a teen

## The Spark of Inspiration
About a month ago, I was introduced to a peer at university who blew my mind. He is an adept touch typist who clocked in speeds of over 130 words per minute, all without looking down at his hands. This opened my eyes as although he's the same age as me, and despite the fact we'd been programming for a similar amount of time, he was able to easily outpace my roughly 50 words per minute. This made me realise the potential level of productivity that I was missing out on, and motivated me to start a journey to pick up these same skills.

## Embracing the Challenge
Motivated to reach the same level as my peer, I embarked on my quest using platforms like TypingClub, Monkeytype, and Keybr. During this time a made a resolution to never look at my hands whilst typing again, and initially my speed took a nosedive. It was a humbling start, but my perseverance was key. Slowly I watched my speed climb as I got used to using muscle memory to type, and eventually I got back to that 60 words per minute, but now without the need to watch my hands.Admittedly it took time to get used to fully using all ten fingers and to stop myself from peeking at the legends on my keyboard, but now that I could type with proper form it felt amazing.

## The Fascination with Vim and ThePrimeagen's Influence
During my exploration of touch typing, I also by chance encountered [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen), a notable programming YouTuber who used this weird software to type without a mouse. This piqued my interest and I soon found out about the Vim text editor and motions. Put simply, with Vim, typing is split into two basic modes, Normal and Insert. The later being self-explanatory which is just normal typing, but Normal mode allows you to move the cursor around the screen which different keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts can chained together to allow for any conceivable action you might want to take, and is greatly more versatile and quicker than a mouse. Again I felt as if my mind had been blown, perhaps even more this time, and this seemingly new arcane way of typing made how I did it previously seem like I had been a caveman with a rock. Watching ThePrimeagen type with a mastery of Vim motivated me again to improve my typing, this time through the avenue of learning these Vim "motions".

I soon added Vim motions into my touch typing practice, and I aimed to enhance my programming speed. These motions, once mastered, enable a programmer to navigate and edit code with unparalleled speed and precision. It's akin to developing a fluency in a language where your fingers instinctively know where to go, turning every keystroke into a purposeful action. Currently I'm not the most knowledgeable of all the available motions, however I have now reached a point where I am more comfortable typing with Vim motions than without. It has greatly improved my speed in which I navigate a text editor, but also has the bonus side-effect of improving my sense of flow whilst programming. Now that I don't need to actively think as much about what I'm physically doing, like moving the mouse to see the quick-docs of a function, or refactoring code, it leaves me in a better state of mind to focus on the problems at hand.

## The Ergonomic Revelation
Finally, my exploration took an exciting turn upon discovering a YouTube video by [Code to the Moon](https://youtu.be/pK41Mr4Kdd0?si=mlXwMoqr1gyVforI), which highlighted the benefits of split keyboards and custom key layers. This insightful content was more than educational; it ignited my curiosity and prompted me to explore the realm of split keyboards further. Renowned online developers like, Jonathan Blow and ThePrimeagen, also advocate for ergo split keyboards such as well known brand Kinesis, which further pushed me to research into which one could potentially suit me. Among the plethora of options, the Glove80 emerged as the ideal choice. Its design resonates with the key ergonomic features I sought: an ortholinear layout for natural finger movement and a curved keywell to minimize key travel and strain. Additionally, its compatibility with ZMK firmware offers extensive customization, allowing me to tailor the keyboard to my exact typing preferences and workflows, thus significantly enhancing comfort and efficiency.

## Reflections and Future Endeavors
As a university student, this month-long journey has been a persistent effort in improving both my work efficiency and physical wellbeing. The integration of touch typing, ergonomic considerations, and Vim has reshaped not just how I type, but how I approach interaction with technology and problem-solving. To fellow students and aspiring programmers, my journey is a testament to the power of embracing challenges and continuously seeking improvement. From touch typing at 20 WPM to maneuvering through code with Vim, each step has been a building block towards a more efficient, health-conscious, and productive approach to technology.

Your journey might be different, but the message is universal: Explore, adapt, and never underestimate the power of the right tools and a well-structured workspace. The journey of discovery and improvement is ongoing, and each step unveils new possibilities and horizons.
