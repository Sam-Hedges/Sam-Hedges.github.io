I‚Äôm Sam Hedges, a highly motivated Engine, Gameplay, and Graphics Programmer with a strong focus on C#, C++, Shaders, and real-time rendering. Currently pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Computer Games Programming at Anglia Ruskin University, I specialize in graphics programming.

With over eight years of experience in game development, I have built tech demos, developed advanced shaders, and created games using industry-standard tools such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. My freelance work includes developing a mobile-friendly shaders for an indie studio, and I have hands-on industry experience, including QA testing at Frontier Developments and work-study at Ninja Theory.

I thrive in collaborative, high-energy environments, constantly pushing my technical skills to new heights. Whether it‚Äôs creating rendering pipelines, designing gameplay systems, or experimenting with new technologies, I am always eager to innovate and create.
