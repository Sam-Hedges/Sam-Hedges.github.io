# **Introduction üïπÔ∏è**

---

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I‚Äôm an aspiring Engine, Gameplay & Graphics Programmer currently a second year student studying Computer Games Programming (BSc) at **[Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, UK](https://goo.gl/maps/3tmaKfV1jfGMTere9)**. I pride myself on my dedicated attitude to working hard, and my lived daily passion for discovery, which enables me to create games to the best of my abilities. The difficulty of computers, programming and games, excites me and motivates me to keep pushing my boundaries, to learn more and more. From Touch-Typing, to Neovim, to programming with C and learning the terminal; as well as Love2D leading to RayLib, to OpenGL and creating my own game engine. I'm deeply self-driven, and desire to work creatively with others to learn from those with more experience, and to create awesome games with people who have that same level of passion as me.

I‚Äôve been making and studying games for over 8 years, and my major achievements include: a distinction in my college course, the opportunities I've had to connect and network with so many industry professionals, and I consider my perseverance in advancing my games development to be my greatest accomplishment. I‚Äôve greatly improved since my start as a developer and feel confident that nothing is out of my reach as I continue to keep learning and advancing my capabilities. I‚Äôm currently aiming for a full-time position within a Game Studio, whether indie or AAA, to gain experience in the industry and expand my skills, knowledge & portfolio.
