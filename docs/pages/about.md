# **About Me**

---

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

As a person, I am passionate, hard-working, motivated, creative, determined, and friendly. These traits make me well-rounded and capable of tackling challenges head-on, no matter the situation. I believe in finding common ground in conflicts, and work to find a solution that benefits everyone involved. My passion for teamwork and leadership shines through in my previous experience as an evening merchandiser, where I took on tasks and allocated jobs to my colleagues in order to free up the supervisor to manage the team better.

Above all, I am passionate about my university work. I love the challenge of creating unique mechanics for the games I work on, and I am inspired by the creativity of others in my field. This passion drives me to further my education and put myself in the best possible position to succeed in the industry.

In my free time, I have several interests that keep me active and engaged. I am dedicated to my personal fitness, and make it a priority to visit the gym multiple times a week. I also enjoy reading books such as Jordan Peterson's "12 Rules for Life" or fiction such as "One Piece." My creative side comes out in my love for making electronic and rap music.
