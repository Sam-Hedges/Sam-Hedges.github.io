# **About Me**

---

Hey, I’m **Sam Hedges**, a game developer with a love for **fitness, music production, and storytelling**. When I’m not programming, I’m either at the gym, producing music for my game projects, or getting lost in a great book.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

# **🎶 Music**

---

I love blending **sound and gameplay**, and I compose original tracks for my projects using **FL Studio**. Whether it’s atmospheric synthwave or intense battle themes, I enjoy experimenting with different styles to bring my games to life.

# **📚 Favorite Books & Games**

---

I’ve always been drawn to **epic fantasy and sci-fi**; _The Inheritance Cycle_ by Christopher Paolini being what started me off, and my all-time favorite series would have to be _Mistborn_ by Brandon Sanderson. I love stories that build deep worlds and unique characters—something I aim to bring into my own game projects. For this same reason I absolutely love the FromSoft games, with Elden Ring taking the top spot of my favourite game of all time. Partially because I love the challenge of these games, and also because of the top-tier environmental storytelling.

# **🏋️‍♂️ Fitness & Gym Life**

---

I started my fitness journey in **May 2022**, and it quickly became a huge part of my life. What started as a way to stay active turned into a **daily discipline** that keeps me focused and motivated. I love pushing my limits, even if most days end up being chest days. Plus, the gym community has become a second family—I even got featured in their anniversary post!
