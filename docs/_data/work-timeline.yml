  description: I'm currently responsible for working all sections of the store including but not limited to; making drinks, 
               overseeing the chips fryer, chicken fryer & beef grill, serving customers via drive-thru headset and front register,
               tracking register monetary values and cleaning / maintaining hygiene throughout the branch. Although not an official position
               I also help with training new hires on these different sections as well as training them on the till systems. I aspire to 
               become an area leader/supervisor before I complete my university degree as this will give me more managerial experience
               before I enter the games development industry or another adjacent satellite industry.

  description: I received deliveries for the store, assisting the unloading of lorries as well as loaded the stores’ salvage. 
               I organised cages of stock to be section compliant so that merchandising was simple for the rest of the team. I 
               replenished stock, faced the shelves, and ensured appropriate stock rotation was in place. I’d completed the in-house 
               food hygiene course which enabled me to manage the food stocks within the store. I organised the warehouse after 
               deliveries and often built fixtures/shelves for new products. I updated scan labels and provided customer service to shoppers.
