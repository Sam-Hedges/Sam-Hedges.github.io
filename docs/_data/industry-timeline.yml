  description: I received request to work on a clients project and submitted individual Action Plans, Design Documents
               and Invoice for the client to approve. I then completed projects to their brief, debugged/tested the work, and formatted it
               appropriately to be delivered. This was my largest commission, for an Indie Developer to create a mobile-friendly lit
               toon shader with RGBA & HSV colour space, gradient control applied over its lightmaps.

  to: Oct 2019
  description: I volunteered via my Cambridge Regional College course to test the, at the time upcoming game, Planet Zoo. Throughout 
               my time spent at the studio I learnt the QA systems that Frontier studios used to test games and applied that knowledge
               in order to report issues with the game. Notably I discovered and highlighted a major issue with an x-ray style shader 
               that was rendering models incorrectly through opaque surfaces.

  description: During this work experience, I shadowed each game development disciplines team, discussing what's
               involved, common practices and the relevant industry standards. This gave me a deep insight early 
               into my development journey as to the production pipelines of games development, the suites of software/tools 
               used within each discipline and the keys skills I need to master in order to enter the industry as a strong
               candidate for employment.

  description: During this work experience, I shadowed the front-end web development team, to gain a complete overview of the industry.
               I was partnered with one of the developers and tasked with creating a website using HTML and CSS. This gave me experience 
               using new suites of languages and tools that I was unfamiliar with, and taught me to be comfortable with experimentation. This 
               eventually led to me creating this very website to showcase my work.
