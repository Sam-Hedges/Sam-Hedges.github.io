# **About Me üïπÔ∏è**

---

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I‚Äôm an aspiring Programmer and Technical Artist currently a second year student studying Computer Games Programming (BSc) at **[Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, UK](https://goo.gl/maps/3tmaKfV1jfGMTere9)**. I‚Äôve been making and studying games for over 7 years, currently proficient with but not limited to Unity & C#, Unreal & C++, and HLSL / CG, as well as having had experience with other software including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects and Substance Designer. I'm passionate about making unique and impressive visual effects/shaders and combining those with compelling gameplay mechanics and engine systems. Seeing my work come together in creative collaborative projects and seeing my peers‚Äô talented work, fuels my desire to keep learning and makes me eager to be part of the games industry. Currently, although I have no major achievements other than a distinction in my college course, I consider my perseverance in advancing my games development skills to be my greatest accomplishment. I‚Äôve greatly improved since my start as a developer and feel confident that nothing is out of my reach as I continue to keep up to date with the latest industry trends. I‚Äôm currently aiming for a full-time position within a Game Studio, whether indie or AAA, to gain experience in the industry and expand my skills, knowledge & portfolio.
