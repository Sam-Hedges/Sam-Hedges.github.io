# **About Me**

---

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am independent with an ability for individual research and learning new skills. I'm proactive, can keep my motivational levels high and have the persistence to stick at a problem until I've cracked it. During my time studying, I have grown as a team leader by helping struggling peers in their efforts to improve. This and working on projects in groups has developed my communicational and time management skills enabling me to keep myself and others organised. Through listening to my peers and understanding the barriers they face I can break down more complex problems to aid their self-development. Currently, I am studying a UAL Level 3 Extended Diploma in Games Development wherein I have shown my aptitude to go beyond what is taught in the curriculum. Having achieved a distinction in the first year of this course I am now researching and teaching myself, with the support of my tutors, further higher-level skills such as shader “HLSL” coding, scriptable render pipeline feature development, creating node-based visual effects and coding for the networking of multiplayer projects. I often use online courses to give me broad outlines of what I am learning and after which, I use forums and official documentation to reinforce the new knowledge. Other skills I have developed include: creating websites with scripting languages such as HTML and CSS, using Photoshop to texture 3D models as well as pack textures in the RGB channels to further optimise the shaders I make, and using Premiere Pro to edit game trailers.
