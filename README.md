## Overview

Well, well, wellâ€¦ Look whoâ€™s here

Caught you. Yep. I see you sneaking a peek at my portfolio README.

Youâ€™re not supposed to be hereâ€¦ or maybe you are? ðŸ˜‰ Either way, I hope you like what you seeâ€¦

Shhâ€¦ donâ€™t tell anyone you saw this part. Seriously.

## Features

- **Jekyll Site**: because I just love typing `bundle exec jekyll serve` for fun.
- **GitHub Pages Hosting**: saving your bank account, one free site at a time.
- **Design**: looks professional thanks to [portfolYOU](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU).

## Setup

For whatever reason you might want to run this site locally:

1.  **Clone the repo**
-   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git`

Wait a minute. You actually want to clone my portfolio? Bold move.
<br><br>
    
2.  **Install Jekyll and bundler gems**
-   `gem install jekyll bundler`

Get your bundler away from my gems!
<br><br>
    
3.  **Run the server**
-   `bundle exec jekyll serve`

You're in too deep at this point, no turning back now.
<br><br>
    
4.  **Open in your browser**  
Navigate to `localhost:4000`

And voilÃ . Youâ€™re officially stalking my portfolio.
